You gotta stand up from your computer to start your college journey there sport!
*You Stand Up*
Well there ya go!
Now the way they got to college was by walkin out of that darn room and showin the world what their made of.
Go on sport!
[[Leave-&gt;Street]]
(link:&quot;Close Door&quot;)[=
But at first they didn&#39;t want to leave their little room.
We&#39;ll im sorry sport but that&#39;s not an option
you can be an internet celebrity and sell your bathwater
*after* you&#39;ve gone to college</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Street" tags="" position="926,163" size="100,100">Ahh. There we go!
Smell the fresh air, do you feel that breeze?
This is the part of the story where my child *chose* to go to college!
[[Go To College -&gt;College]]
[[Don&#39;t Go To College -&gt;Not College]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="College" tags="" position="1102,161" size="100,100">Ahaha! Fantastic choice sport!
There were many exciting challenges that my child faced at college!
The first of which was what major to pick?

Now of course, my child chose Business Entreprenuership
You&#39;ve always been extremely industrius sport, and that&#39;s what I&#39;ve always loved about you.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="Not College" tags="" position="773,285" size="100,100">Woah! Hold on there sport!
You&#39;re going the wrong way!
Let me help you out!
*Teleports you back to the street*
[[Go Back To The Street-&gt;Street2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Street2" tags="" position="921,318" size="100,100">Whew, you almost went the wrong way there sport!
Now to help you out with my story I&#39;ve made a sign for you!
*A sign pops up that says*

&#39;&#39;Go

College&#39;&#39;

Ok, now make your decision.
[[Go To College -&gt;College]]
[[Don&#39;t Go To College -&gt;Not College2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Not College2" tags="" position="777,415" size="100,100">Ok, allright sport.
Listen.. I know you probably hate school right now.
We all did, certainly your mom and I did when we finished highschool.
But let me ask you this?
If you decide you want to go back to college later
Are you gonna remember all that complex math you learned in highschool?
Here let me show you something
*teleports you back to the street*
[[Back to the street-&gt;Street3]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="Street3" tags="" position="915,487" size="100,100">*You are now back at the street, but now there is a chalk board with *
&#39;&#39;2 + 2 = ?&#39;&#39;
Ok sport! This here is an easy one! But as you answer, ask yourself. Will I remember how to do this a year, two years, even a decade from now?

*You can also see the directions that indicate college and not college have signs with answers on them that have been created fairly hastily*
[[4 / College-&gt;College Trick]]
[[32 / NotCollege-&gt;Not College 3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="College Trick" tags="" position="1074,484" size="100,100">Double-click this passage to edit it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="Not College 3" tags="" position="775,563" size="100,100">GHASP!
It&#39;s happening quicker than I thought!
You&#39;ve only been out of highschool for a day and you&#39;ve already forgotten how to do 2 plus 2!
Well sport. I hope you see now why it&#39;s so important that you go to college as quickly as possible!
At this rate you might forget how to read by next week!
*Teleports you back to the street*
[[Go Back To The Street-&gt;Street4]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="Street4" tags="" position="916,641" size="100,100">*You are back at the street again, but now you see a sign that has gibberish written on it*
Actually to be honest sport, I&#39;m a little worried about that whole reading thing.
Tell me what does this sign say?
[[Optometrist-&gt;College Job]]
[[Cashier-&gt;Not College 4]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="College Job" tags="" position="1077,640" size="100,100">Haha! Well, that&#39;s a relief.
Do you know where you have to go to become an ... optometrist?
Well.. you&#39;re a smart kid, i&#39;ll let you figure that one out on your own.
Let me show you something else
*Teleports you somewhere else*
[[Teleport Somewhere Else-&gt;Shmisneyland]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="Not College 4" tags="" position="776,731" size="100,100">Well, sport this is more troubling to me than I thought.
It seems like the decision is making itself!
Now, just turn around and lets make get that degree!

[[Turn Around-&gt;College]] 
[[Continue-&gt;NotCollegeBoss]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="NotCollegeBoss" tags="" position="778,885" size="100,100">NOOOOO!!
This is not how the story is supposed to go!
*A demon drops down from the sky onto the street destroying some buildings*
YOU WILL GO TO COLLEGE FOR YOUR OWN GOOD!
*Boss fight ensues*

[[Defeat Dad-Demon-&gt;NotCollegeEnding]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="14" name="NotCollegeEnding" tags="" position="776,1031" size="100,100">*The boss is now defeated and shrinks down to the size of a normal sheep*
*It is clearly the sheeps father*

Listen sport,
I&#39;ve cared and protected you for your whole life.
I&#39;ve worked hard to give you the best possible start to your life as possible.
And you&#39;ve done great! You worked hard! You always tried your best.
But I guess the majority of my job is done.
It&#39;s your life now.
All I ask is that you reach out if you need any help.
And let your dear old dad know how you&#39;re doing.
After all I&#39;m still your dad.
Go get-em tiger.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="15" name="Shmisneyland" tags="" position="1235,643" size="100,100">*You are at the entrance of shmisneyland*
Welcome to shmisneyland!
You love shmisneyland! Don&#39;t you sport?
Go ahead! Explore! My treat!

(link:&quot;Go See Jimmy Jerboa!&quot;)[
*You go to see Jimmy Jerboa He is so small he is barely a spec on the screen*
Wow, look sport! It&#39;s Jimmy Jerboa!
You love Jimmy Jerboa! 
Doesn&#39;t he look just like you imagined?
And sport I can garuntee you that whatever actor they shoved inside that tiny costume ... probably didn&#39;t go to college.
